1. My Jesus

He makes a way where there ain't no way
Rises up from an empty grave
Ain't no sinner that He can't save
Let me tell you 'bout my Jesus

His love is strong and His grace is free
And the good news is I know that He
Can do for you what He's done for me
Let me tell you 'bout my Jesus
And let my Jesus change your life
 
[Post-Chorus]

Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, amen, amen
 
 Repeat Chorus 
 
Post chorus ending

Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, amen, amen
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah
Let my Jesus change your life
