Amazing Grace (My Chains are Gone) 

Amazing grace how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost, but now I'm found
Was blind but now I see

Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,
And grace my fears relieved;
How precious did that grace appear,
The hour I first believed!

Chorus:
My chains are gone, I've been set free.
My God, My Savior has ransomed me.
And like a flood his mercy reigns.
Un-ending love, amazing grace

The Lord has promised good to me,
His word my hope secures;
He will my shield and portion be,
As long as life endures.

(repeat chorus) 2x

The earth shall soon dissolve like snow,
The sun forbear to shine;
But God, who called me here below,
Will be forever mine.
(Will be forever mine)
(You are forever mine)
