              		4. Father

Father, Father, can I tell You how I feel?
Warm and safe within Your strong arms,
I love You so.

Jesus, Jesus, can I tell You how I feel?
Sins forgiven, given new life,
I love You so.

Spirit, Spirit, can I tell You how I feel?
Full of joy and peace and wisdom,
I love You so.
