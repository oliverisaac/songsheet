                                   19.  There is a Redeemer
There is a Redeemer,
Jesus, Godâ€™s own Son.
Precious Lamb of God, Messiah, 
Holy One.

Thank, You, O my Father
For giving us Your Son,
And leaving Your Spirit-
Till the work on earth is done.

Jesus my Redeemer,
Name above all names,
Precious Lamb of God
Messiah, O for sinners slain.

Chorus
