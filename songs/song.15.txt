15. Who You Say I Am 
by Hillsong Worship
Who am I that the highest King
Would welcome me?
I was lost but He brought me in
Oh His love for me
Oh His love for me
 
[Chorus]
Who the Son sets free
Oh is free indeed
I'm a child of God
Yes I am
 
Free at last, He has ransomed me
His grace runs deep
While I was a slave to sin, Jesus died for me
Yes He died for me
 
[Chorus 2]
Who the Son sets free
Oh is free indeed
I'm a child of God
Yes I am
In my Father's house
There's a place for me
I'm a child of God
             Yes I am

[Bridge]
I am chosen, not forsaken, I am who You say I am
You are for me, Not against me
I am who You say I am
I am who You say I am

 REPEAT Bridge

 REPEAT CHORUS 2
