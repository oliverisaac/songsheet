8.  Mighty to Save

Everyone needs compassion
a Love that's never failing
let mercy fall on me
Everyone needs forgiveness
the kindness of a savior
the hope of nations

Savior, he can move the mountains
my God is mighty to save
he is mighty to save
forever, author of salvation
he rose and conquered the grave
Jesus conquered the grave
        	
So take me as you find me
all my fears and failures
and fill my life again
I give my life to follow                     
everything I believe in
now I surrender 

Repeat chorus 

Shine your light and let the whole world see,  singing,
for the glory of the risen king, Jesus   
Shine your light and let the whole world see,  singing,
for the glory of the risen king.

REPEAT chorus 

Shine your light and let the whole world see,  singing,
for the glory of the risen king, Jesus   
Shine your light and let the whole world see,  singing,
for the glory of the risen king.
