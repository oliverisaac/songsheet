9.  Great Are You Lord

You give life, You are love
You bring light to the darkness
You give hope, You restore
Every heart that is broken
Great are You, Lord

It's Your breath in our lungs
So we pour out our praise, we pour out our praise
It's Your breath in our lungs
So we pour out our praise to You only

You give life, You are love
You bring light to the darkness
You give hope, You restore
Every heart that is broken
Great are You, Lord

[Chorus]
  
[Bridge]
All the earth will shout Your praise
Our hearts will cry, these bones will sing
Great are You, Lord (3x)

[Chorus]
