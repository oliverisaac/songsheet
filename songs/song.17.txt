                   17. Jesus Paid it All 

I hear the Savior say
"Thy strength indeed is small;
Child of weakness, watch and pray,
Find in Me thine all in all.‚Äù

Jesus paid it all,
All to Him I owe;
Sin had left a crimson stain,
He washed it white as snow.

Lord, now indeed I find
Thy pow'r, and Thine alone,
Can change the leper's spots
And melt the heart of stone.

And when before the throne 
I stand in Him complete,
Jesus died, my soul to save
My lips shall still repeat.

Chorus

Oh Praise the One who paid my debt
and raised this life up from the dead (repeat 3x)

Jesus paid it all,
All to Him I owe;
Sin had left a crimson stain,
He washed it white as snow
