Lean on Me


Sometimes in our lives
We all have pain
We all have sorrow
But if we are wise
We know that there’s always tomorrow.


Chorus:

    Lean on me.  
    When you’re not strong
    And I’ll be your friend
    I’ll help you carry on.
    For, it won’t be long
    ‘till I’m gonna need, 
    Somebody to lean on.


Come unto Me now, 
All who are weak and heavy laden
Cast all your cares down, 
Down at my feet,
And I’ll carry your burden.

[Chorus]

You just call on me brother
When you need a hand.
We all need somebody to lean on.
I just might have a problem that you’ll understand
We all need somebody to lean on.

[Chorus]
