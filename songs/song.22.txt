22.  Shout to the Lord

My Jesus, My Savior
Lord, there is none like you
All of my days,.... I want to praise
The wonders of your migh...ty.....love

My comfort, My Shelter
Tower of refuge and strength
Let every breath, all that I am
never cease to wor.....ship...you

Shout to the Lord, all the earth let us sing
Power and majesty, praise to the king
Mountains bow down and the seas will roar,
at the sound of your na----me

I sing for joy at the work of your hands 
Forever I'll love you, forever I'll stand
Nothing compares to the promise I have in you
