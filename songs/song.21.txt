21.  My Eyes are Dry
My eyes are dry,
My faith is old
My heart is hard,
My prayers are cold.
And I know how I ought to be,
Alive to You and dead to me

Oh, what can be done
For an old heart like mine.
Soften it up with oil and wine.
The oil is You, Your spirit of love,
Please wash me anew, 
In the wine of your blood
