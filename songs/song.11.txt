Great Is Thy Faithfulness 

Great is thy faithfulness, O God my Father, there is no shadow of turning with Thee
Thou changest not, Thy compassions they fail not, As Thou has been, Thou forever wilt be.

Great is Thy faithfulness!
Great is Thy faithfulness!
Morning by morning new mercies I see.
All I have needed Thy hand hath provided
Great is Thy faithfulness, Lord unto me.

Summer and winter, and springtime and harvest, Sun, moon, and stars in their courses above
Join with all nature in manifold witness, To Thy great faithfulness, mercy and love.

(Chorus)

Pardon for sin and a peace that endureth, Thy own dear presence to cheer and to guide.
Strength for today and bright hope for tomorrow, Blessings all mine, with ten thousand beside.

(Chorus)
