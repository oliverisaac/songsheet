24. Jesus Lifted High

CHORUS:
  I want to see Jesus lifted high 
  I want to see Jesus lifted high x4 

Verse 1:
  Though I may suffer for a while,
  I have a hope thatâ€™s undefiled 
  I see the part but not the whole
  I know this world is not my home 

(CHORUS)

Verse 2:
  I only have one hope to hold,
  Where sin is crushed and hearts unfold 
  This King who died and took my place
  He stood and walked out of the grave 
  He stood and walked out of the grave 

(CHORUS)

BRIDGE:
  You get the last word
  You always do 
  You know the best way
  You always move 
  You have the best heart
  You always will 
  Be lifted high 

(CHORUS)
