                          5. Good Good Father

Oh, I've heard a thousand stories of what they think You're like
But I've heard the tender whisper of love in the dead of night
And You tell me that You're pleased
And that I am never alone

'Cause You're a Good, Good Father
It's who You are, it's who You are, it's who You are
And I'm loved by You
It's who I am, it's who I am, it's who I am

And I've seen many searching for answers far and wide
But I know we're all searching
For answers only You provide
'Cause You know just what we need
Before we can say a word

 (repeat chorus)


You're perfect in all of Your ways
You're perfect in all of Your ways
You're perfect in all of Your ways to us 
(repeat)


Love so undeniable, I can hardly speak
Peace so unexplainable, I can hardly think
As You call me deeper still
As You call me deeper still
As You call me deeper still
Into love, love, love

Repeat chorus 

You're perfect in all of Your ways 
You're perfect in all of Your ways 
You're perfect in all of Your ways to us
