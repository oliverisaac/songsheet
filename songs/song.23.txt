23. Lord I Need You

Lord, I come, I confess
Bowing here I find my rest
Without You I fall apart
You're the One that guides my heart

    (Chorus)
Lord, I need You,
Oh, I need You
Every hour I need You
My one defense,
My righteousness
Oh God, how I need You

Where sin runs deep Your grace is more
Where grace is found is where You are 
Where You are, Lord, I am free
Holiness is Christ in me

(Repeat chorus)

    (Bridge)
So Teach my song to rise to You
When temptation comes my way
When I cannot stand I'll fall on You 
Jesus, You're my hope and stay

(repeat bridge)

Jesus, You're my hope and stay

(Repeat chorus)
