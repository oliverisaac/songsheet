23. LORD I NEED YOU

Lord, I come, I confess
Bowing here I find my rest
Without You I fall apart
You're the One  that guides my heart

Lord, I need You, oh, I need You
Every hour I need You
My one defense,     my righteousness
Oh God, how I need You

Where sin runs deep Your grace is more
Where grace is found is where You are 
where You are, Lord, I am free
Holiness    is Christ in me

Lord, I need You, oh, I need You
Every hour I need You 
My one defense,     my righteousness
Oh God, how I need You

So Teach my song to rise to You
When temptation comes my way
when I cannot stand I'll fall on You 
Jesus, You're my hope and stay

(repeat bridge)

Jesus, You're my hope and stay

Repeat chorus
