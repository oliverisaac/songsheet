Jesus You Alone

Who is the great King of glory, Seated on high in the heavens?
Oh-oh-oh, Jesus, You alone, 
You are the Lord God Almighty, Strong in compassion and mercy, 
Oh-oh-oh, Jesus, You alone

I've searched the world, for a love that could fill my heart
nothing compares to the wonder of who You are
Holy, all the earth singing Holy
all the angels cry Holy, Jesus, You alone
Jesus, You alone


You set the stars in the heavens, You set the world into motion
Oh-oh-oh, Jesus, You alone
You breathed Your life in creation, You walked among Your created
Oh-oh-oh, Jesus, You alone 	

And I've searched the world, for a love that could fill my heart
nothing compares to the wonder of who You are
Holy, all the earth singing Holy, 
all the angels cry Holy, Jesus, You alone 
Worthy, all the creation, sings worthy
All the heavens exalt Thee, Jesus, You alone
Jesus, You alone

You shed Your blood for salvation, You broke the curse for our freedom
Oh-oh-oh, Jesus, You alone
You rose from death with the morning, You'll come again in Your glory
Oh-oh-oh, Jesus, You alone
Oh-oh-oh, Jesus, You alone

Holy, I can't help but sing Holy, 
How my heart cries out, Holy, Jesus, You alone
Worthy, I lift my voice and sing Worthy, 
I bow my life to exalt Thee, Jesus, You alone
Jesus, You alone
