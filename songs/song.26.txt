Light The Fire In My Heart Again 

I stand to praise You
But I fall on my knees
My spirit is willing
But my flesh is so weak

[Chorus:]
    Light the fire
      (light the fire)
    In my soul
      (in my weary soul)
    Fan the flame
      (fan the flame)
    Make me whole
      (make my spirit whole)
    Lord, You know
      (Lord, You know)
    Just where I've been
      (where I've been)
    So light the fire
    in my heart again

I feel Your arms around me
As the power of
Your healing begins
Your spirit moves through me
Like a mighty rushing wind

[Chorus]

[Chorus]

light the fire in my heart again
light the fire in my heart again
