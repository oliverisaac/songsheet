6.  Jesus There's No One Like You 

There is no song we could sing to honor the weight of Your glory 
There are no words we could speak 
To capture the depth of Your beauty
         
        Jesus, there's no one like You; Jesus, we love You,  
        Ever adore You       
        There's no one like You; Jesus, we love You, ever 
        adore You, Lord
 
There is no sinner beyond the infinite stretch of your mercy                                               
How can we thank You enough for how You have loved us completely

        Jesus, there's no one like You; Jesus, we love You,  
        Ever adore You       
        There's no one like You; Jesus, we love You, ever 
        adore You, Lord
        There's no one like You; Jesus, we love You, ever 
        adore You, Lord
        There's no one like You; Jesus, we love You, ever 
        adore You, Lord
		

BRIDGE:   All we have, all we need, all we want is You (3x)
