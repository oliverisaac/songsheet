16. O Come to the Alter

Are you hurting and broken within
Overwhelmed by the weight of you sin
Jesus is calling
Have you come to the end of yourself
Do you thirst for a drink from the well
Jesus is calling

O come to
The altar 
The father's arms are open wide
Forgiveness 
Was bought with
The precious blood of Jesus Christ

Leave behind your regrets and mistakes
Come today theres no reason to wait
Jesus is calling
Bring your sorrows and trade them for joy
From the ashes a new life is born
Jesus is calling
              		
chorus

[Bridge]
O what a savior isn't he wonderful
Sing alleluia
Christ is risen
Bow down before him, for he is Lord of all
Sing alleluia
Christ is risen
